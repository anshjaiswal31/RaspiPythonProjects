PIR Sensor - Detect Motion & Raise an Alarm (https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/ReadingAnalogSensors) 
- This project detects presence of intruders in the room using the PIR sensor and sets of an alarm. 
- This program reads analog sensor values using an MCP 3008. An MCP 3008 is required since the Raspberry Pi does not have an ADC or Analog to Digital converter and is not in a position to read analog signals by itself.  
- Components required include
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 (I have used a 3, Model B. You can use whatever you have at your disposal.)
  - 1 x PIR Motion Sensor
    - https://littlebirdelectronics.com.au/products/mcp3008-8-channel-10-bit-adc-with-spi-interface
  - 1 x Breadboard
  - 1 x Extension cable (Suggested) to extend the GPIO ports of the Raspberry Pi and bring them closed to the breadboard
  - 10 x Jumper cables - Female (connect to Rasberry Pi GPIO) to Male (Connect to the Breadboard)
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi Cobbler board (Recommended, to breakout the GPIO's) and make working easier
- To setup the project you will need to -

  - Download and install the Adafruit libraries to interact with the MCP3008
