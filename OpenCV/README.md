OpenCV - This repository hosts code for various python OpenCV projects that have been developed for the Raspberry Pi.

- Roadmap includes - 
  - Step 1 - Simple capture of images.
  - Step 2 -  Capture video and look for faces.
  - Step 3 -  Capture video, look for faces and once faces are found log image to disk.
  - Step 4 -  Capture video, look for faces and once faces are found log image to AWS S3.
  - Step 5 -  Capture video, look for faces, once faces are found log image to AWS S3, compare uploaded image to orignal image at S3 using AWS rekognition, display results of face comparison.
  - Step 6 -  Capture video, look for faces, once faces are found log image to AWS S3, compare uploaded image to orignal image at S3 using AWS rekognition, display results of face comparison, verbalise results using STT (Speech To Text).
  - Step 7 -  Capture video, look for faces, once faces are found log image to AWS S3, use AWS Lambda to launch a step function which compares uploaded image to orignal image at S3 using AWS rekognition.
  - Step 8 -  Capture video, look for faces, once faces are found log image to AWS S3, use AWS Lambda to launch a step function which compares uploaded image to orignal image at S3 using AWS rekognition, results of comparison is send through SNS as a published message.
  - Step 9 -  Capture video, look for faces, once faces are found log image to AWS S3, use AWS Lambda to launch a step function which compares uploaded image to orignal image at S3 using AWS rekognition, results of comparison is send through SNS as a published message, Raspberry Pi picks up message as a subscriber to the topic and reads results of face comparison, verbalise results using STT (Speech To Text).

- Projects include - 
  - OpenCV Simple CaptureImage -
    - This was the first program i got started with. It's a very basic OpenCV program which warms up the camera and captures an image.
    - Review the code at - https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/OpenCV/CaptureSingleImage
  - OpenCV Scan & CaptureFaces - 
    - FaceDetect1 - 
      - This piece of code was adopted from https://realpython.com/blog/python/face-recognition-with-python/. 
      - This code provides basic functionality to track faces. You can access the code at https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/OpenCV/CaptureFaces/FaceDetect1
    - FaceDetect2 - 
      - This piece of code provides functionality to scan an image provided at the command line or as acquired from the Pi Camera with the objective of identifying faces. 
      - This project using the Face Cascase HAAR filters and draws rectangles around the faces on the captured image. 
      - Review the code at https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/OpenCV/CaptureFaces/FaceDetect2
  - OpenCV Capture Images from VideoStream and store on AWS S3
    - This project is designed to capture video from the Raspberry Pi camera and continuously scan the content for faces
    - This project using the Face Cascase HAAR filters and draws rectangles around the faces. 
    - Once faces have been identified in an image the image is logged to AWS S3
    - Review code for the project at https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/OpenCV/CaptureVideoStream
