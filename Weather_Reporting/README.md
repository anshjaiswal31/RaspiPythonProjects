Weather Data Acquisition & Reporting (https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/Weather_Reporting) 

- The Sense_Temp_Humidity project (above) was designed as a simple IoT (Internet Of Things) project to pull data from my DHT11 on the Raspberry Pi to be uploaded to ThingSpeak.
- Weather Reporting on the other hand pulls data from OpenWeatherMap and uploads the data to Thingspeak. 
- The Weather Reporting project was eventually updated to log information to the local file system for purposes of further analysis. 
- The objective of this (Weather Reporting) project was to obtain the last value of the temperature, humidity from OWM (Open Weather Map) for the local city, log the data to disk and also upload to an IoT platform.
- The weather data (temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.) after being logged is uploaded to ThingSpeak IoT platform.
