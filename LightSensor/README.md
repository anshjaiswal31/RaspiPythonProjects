Simple light sensor (https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/LightSensor)
- The Simple Light Sensor is a very simple program that detects the presence of light or darkness
- Components required include -
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 (I have used a 3, Model B. You can use whatever you have at your disposal.)
  - 1 x Photoresistor Light Sensor module

    - The first two links very closely resemble the one I've used
  - 1 x Breadboard
  - 1 x Extension cable (Suggested) to extend the GPIO ports of the Raspberry Pi and bring them closed to the breadboard
  - 10 x Jumper cables - Female (connect to Rasberry Pi GPIO) to Male (Connect to the Breadboard)
  - 1 x Tactile Push button
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi Cobbler board (Recommended, to breakout the GPIO's) and make working easier
