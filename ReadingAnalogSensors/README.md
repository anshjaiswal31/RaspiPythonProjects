Simple Motion sensor or PIR (https://github.com/tangowhisky37/RaspiPythonProjects/tree/master/PIR)
- This Simple Motion Sensor is a very simple program that detects the presence in a room using the PIR sensor and sets of an alarm 
- Components required include
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 (I have used a 3, Model B. You can use whatever you have at your disposal.)
  - 1 x PIR Motion Sensor

  - 1 x Breadboard
  - 1 x Extension cable (Suggested) to extend the GPIO ports of the Raspberry Pi and bring them closed to the breadboard
  - 10 x Jumper cables - Female (connect to Rasberry Pi GPIO) to Male (Connect to the Breadboard)
  - 1 x Tactile Push button
  - 1 x Raspberry Pi Cobbler board (Recommended, to breakout the GPIO's) and make working easier
